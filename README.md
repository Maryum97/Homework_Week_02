The main homework files contained index.html and styles.css. A number of changes were made in the code locally on VSC. Those changes are listed below for each of HTML and CSS.

<i>HTML:</i> 
Different semantic tags were integrated in the HTML code, in order to improve the outlook of the code and website, including the following:
1. Added <header> "header" tag for title and navigation links
2. Added <footer> "footer" tag for website credits
